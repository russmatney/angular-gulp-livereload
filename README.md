#angular-playground

stupid-simple, clone-able, live-reload playground for front-end angular demoing

##Why?

Intended to be a quick jumping off point for a hack session, presentation, or
blog post.

##Up and running

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

Route to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

##Contains

- basic gulpfile with livereload on file-save (.js or .html files)
- bootstrap and angular included via bower
- one controller hooked into the index.html for quick demo purposes

##TODO:

- Add unit tests via karma
- Use Less, get live-reload going for stylesheets
